# ESP Air Sync
## An ESP32 Remote Audio Output Protocol (AirPlay1) Receiver

A high-quality RAOP audio receiver implementation for ESP32 boards with external PSRAM and a PCM5102a DAC, featuring multi-room synchronization and robust audio buffering.

## Features

- **AirPlay Audio Streaming**: Full AirPlay 1 protocol support with authentication
- **Multi-room Sync**: Synchronized playback across multiple AirPlay devices
- **High-Quality Audio**: PCM5102A DAC support via I²S (44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo)
- **Software Volume Control**: Smooth volume adjustment
- **ALAC Decoding**: Apple Lossless audio codec support
- **Robust Buffering**: ~23 seconds of audio buffering with automatic drift correction
- **WLED Audio-Reactive Sync**: Real-time FFT analysis streamed to WLED devices for audio-reactive lighting effects (optional)
- **Web Configuration**: Simple web interface for WiFi setup and I²S pin configuration
- **WiFi Provisioning**: Easy setup via captive portal

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32-WROVER-B** (4MB PSRAM required)
- **PCM5102A DAC** or compatible I²S DAC
- Power supply (5V recommended)

### Default I²S Pin Configuration

- BCK (Bit Clock): GPIO 26
- WS (Word Select/LRCLK): GPIO 25
- DOUT (Data Out): GPIO 22

Pins can be reconfigured via the web interface.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v5.5.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.1/esp32/get-started/index.html)
- Python 3.8+

### Building and Flashing

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/edu_coder/esp-airsync.git
cd esp-airsync
```

2. Set up ESP-IDF environment:
```bash
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

3. Configure (optional):
```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

4. Build:
```bash
idf.py build
```

5. Flash to device:
```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

### Initial Configuration

1. On first boot, the device creates a WiFi access point named `ESP-AIRSYNC-XXXXXX`
2. Connect to this network (password: `espairsync`)
3. Navigate to `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. Enter your WiFi credentials and configure I²S pins if needed
5. Configure device name, if desired
5. Reboot device to save settings and connect to configured wifi

### Firmware Updates (OTA)

Once the device is running and connected to WiFi, firmware can be updated without a USB connection via the built-in OTA update page in the web interface:

1. Download the appropriate binary for your board from the [Releases page](https://codeberg.org/Edu_Coder/esp-airsync/releases):
   - `esp-airsync-esp32.bin` for ESP32-WROVER-B
   - `esp-airsync-esp32s3.bin` for ESP32-S3 N16R8
2. Navigate to the device's web interface and go to **Firmware Update**
3. Select the `.bin` file and click upload — the device will flash and reboot automatically

The current firmware version is displayed on the update page.

## WLED Audio-Reactive Sync

esp-airsync can stream real-time FFT audio analysis to a WLED device, enabling audio-reactive lighting effects synchronized to your music.

### Requirements

- A WLED device running on an ESP32 (ESP8266 is not supported for audio sync)
- WLED firmware with the AudioReactive usermod enabled

### WLED Device Setup

1. Open the WLED web interface on your WLED device
2. Navigate to **Config → Usermods**
3. Scroll to the **AudioReactive** section at the bottom
4. Set **Sync mode** from `Off` to `Receive`
5. Save and reboot the WLED device

### esp-airsync Configuration

In the esp-airsync web interface, configure the following settings and reboot to apply:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | Enable or disable WLED sync |
| **Host** | IP address or multicast group of your WLED device (default: `239.0.0.1` for multicast) |
| **Port** | UDP port for audio sync packets (default: `11988`) |
| **Channel** | Audio channel to analyse: `mono` (L+R mixdown), `left`, or `right` |

> **Note**: All configuration changes require a reboot to take effect.

### How It Works

Audio frames are captured at the point of I²S output — when audio is actually playing — and passed through a 1024-point FFT. The resulting 16-band frequency spectrum is packed into a WLED V2 UDP audio sync packet and sent to the configured destination. This produces lighting effects that are accurately synchronized to the audio you hear.

### Usage

Once configured:
1. Device appears as the configured device name in your AirPlay device list
2. Select it from iTunes, OwnTone, or any AirPlay-compatible application
3. Audio streams with automatic synchronization for multi-room playback

## Architecture

- **RTSP Server**: Handles AirPlay control protocol
- **RTP Receiver**: Manages audio packet reception, ALAC decoding, and jitter buffering
- **Audio Buffer**: Large PSRAM-based ring buffer with timing-aware playback (Core 1)
- **I²S Output**: Hardware audio interface with software volume control (Core 1)
- **WLED Sync**: FFT computation (Core 0) and UDP sender (Core 1) for audio-reactive lighting
- **Timing Sync**: NTP-based synchronization for multi-room playback

## Technical Details

### Memory Usage
- **PSRAM**: ~2.7MB for audio buffers (RTP jitter buffer + ring buffer)
- **DRAM**: ~180KB for code and data
- **Flash**: ~900KB application binary

### Network Requirements
- 2.4GHz WiFi (ESP32 limitation)
- Multicast DNS (mDNS) support on your network
- UDP ports for RTP, control, and timing packets (dynamically allocated)

## Troubleshooting

### Device not appearing in AirPlay list
- Ensure device and client are on the same network
- Check that mDNS/Bonjour is not blocked by firewall
- Verify device has successfully connected to WiFi (check serial monitor)

### Audio dropouts or stuttering
- Check WiFi signal strength
- Check for interference from other 2.4GHz sources (microwaves, other wifi routers)
- Monitor for "Buffer full" or "Skipping late frame" warnings in logs

### Authentication failures
- RSA authentication errors indicate mbedtls issues
- Ensure ESP-IDF v5.5.1 is being used
